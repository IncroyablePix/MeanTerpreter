## Abstract
Just a stupid research project that I've written in less than a day just to try to understand the underlying principles of programming languages, compilers, interpreters, etc.

## Supports
This "language" supports mathematical operators:
* +
* -
* /
* *
* ^

It has also support for unary mathematical functions such as:
* sin
* cos
* tan

You can also declare and use variables like in a lot of programming languages:
1. a = 2 + 3
2. sin(a)

## Does not support
This language was written quick and dirty, it doesn't support any of these:
* function creation
* loops
* ...any control structure

## Bugs
There are some bugs such as a crash when you enter plain (1+1), but wierdly, it works if you have already written something like sin(1+1), which doesn't make sense.

Operators precedence can be funny.

## Conclusion
It was interesting. This language is not turing complete and thus completely useless but makes a great calculator for people who hate graphical software.
